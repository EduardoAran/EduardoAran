A computer systems engineer who is still continuing with his studies in the field of fullstack. Talking abaout my progress I have designed diferente web pages, applications, games, among other things, with the usage of different languages such as ReactJS, Python, JavaScript, C++, C#, Github, Unity, etc. Thanks to my university, I have developed several useful skills, which help me and will help me in the future to continue developing my self. At the same time, our projects were real cases in which we had to interact with various companies and deliver the project following the requirements sought in a certain time frame.

Now I will show some projects in which I was part of the creation. I feel very proud of them. They can be improved, of course, but for what I knew at the moment they are fine.

### [Proyecto Robot/Cajas](https://github.com/EduardoAran/robot_cajas)

In this project we were given the challenge of developing a code with the "mesa" tool, which consisted of some robots taking boxes from the plan and taking them to a loading area, that loading area had a maximum capacity, so the robot had to know and respond to what was given to it. This especific proyecto was done myself and it might not be perfect, but it did what was asked for.

### [Proyecto Genjutsucom](https://github.com/EduardoAran/Aplicacion_GenJutsucom)

This application was created with the goal of being able to help people learn sign language within a company and at the same time give them tests with which they can demonstrate their progress of what they have learned. In this project I worked on the creation of the application both in the frontend and in the backend.

Now I will name some of my technical and soft skills, which I developed while my student life was going on.

- Technical skills: Programming in different languages, database design, knowledge of operating systems, management of software development tools, software testing, amoung others.
- Soft skills: Effective communication, teamwork, leadership, problem solving, adaptability, among others.

Not only do I dedicate myself 100 percent to coding, I also have hobbies such as exercising, practicing and learning different types of sports, listening to music, and spending good time with family and friends.
